## 🏗️ Architecture & Philosophy

- **🧩 Unified Codebase**: Manage both behavior and resource packs in a single repository.
- **⚡ Automated Workflow**: Accelerate iteration with a single build-and-deploy command (to `com.mojang`).
- **🛡️ TypeScript First**: Write safer scripts with pre-configured TypeScript and smart editor features.
- **📦 npm Powered**: Use external libraries effortlessly. Esbuild automatically bundles imported packages.

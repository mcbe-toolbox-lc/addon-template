This TypeScript-based all-in-one template is designed to free Minecraft Bedrock add-on development
from manual labor.

configuration.

## :building_construction: Architecture & Philosophy

- **:jigsaw: Unified Codebase**: Manage both behavior and resource packs in a single repository.
- **:zap: Automated Workflow**: Accelerate iteration with a single build-and-deploy command (to `com.mojang`).
- **:shield: TypeScript First**: Write safer scripts with pre-configured TypeScript and smart editor features.
- **:package: npm Powered**: Use external libraries effortlessly. Esbuild automatically bundles imported packages.

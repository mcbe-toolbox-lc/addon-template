## Introduction

### The Problem ⚠️

Most add-on developers store their packs like this:

```
AppData
└── ...
    └── com.mojang
        ├── development_behavior_packs
        │   ├── addon-x-bp
        │   ├── addon-y-bp
        │   └── addon-z-bp
        └── development_resource_packs
            ├── addon-x-rp
            ├── addon-y-rp
            └── addon-z-rp
```

Packs of a single add-on are **dispersed and fragmented**.
The biggest problem is probably that **it makes version control difficult**.
You can't easily track changes across both packs simultaneously in a single repository.

### The Solution 💡

The solution is to put both packs in a single "project folder" like this:

```
my-addons
└── addon-x   <--- The project folder, or we can call it a repository
    ├── src
    │   ├── bp
    │   └── rp
    └── ... project-specific files ...
```

This project folder is the single, top-level directory that acts as the **centralized workspace**
for your add-on. It should be the root of your source code and version control (e.g., Git),
**containing both the BP and RP** as well as any source code, resources, and build configurations.

### The Solution Implemented 🏗️

**This template implements the solution above.**

Minecraft won't recognize packs outside the default locations, so this template has a custom build
script that does _some nice things_ and copies each of your packs to where they should be.

Some nice things that happen during a build operation include:

- Compiling (bundling) behavior pack scripts that are written in JavaScript/TypeScript.
  - Optionally, external dependencies can be bundled together.
- Converting [JSON5](https://json5.org/) files into plain JSON.
- Generating [texture_list.json](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/textures-list) in resource pack.
- Creating `.mcpack` or `.mcaddon` archive(s).

**It's fully configured.**
I've been doing this approach for my recent add-ons, and it works great!

## Prerequisites

If you understand these, things should be easier to understand:

- Git - [Git Tutorial For Dummies ▶️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY)
- Basic add-on development - [Bedrock Wiki 🎓](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/guide/introduction)
- JavaScript - [Tutorial by W3Schools 🎓](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- Node.js - [Tutorial by W3Schools 🎓](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp)

Please install these tools on your system before proceeding:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Directory Structure

- `.vscode/`: Configuration for the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor.
- `scripts/`: Build scripts and task automation scripts. Not behavior pack scripts!
- `src/`: Contains the BP and the RP.
- `src/bp/`: BP (Behavior Pack) source code and assets.
- `src/rp/`: RP (Resource Pack) source code and assets.
- `.editorconfig`: [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file.
- `.gitattributes`: Configures per-path Git behaviors.
- `.gitignore`: Tells Git which files to ignore in a repository.
- `.prettierignore`: Tells Prettier which files to ignore in a repository.
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier (code formatter) configuration.
- `package.json`: Node.js package configuration.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Ensures consistent dependency installs and versions.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: pnpm's workspace configuration file.
- `tsconfig.base.json`: Base TypeScript configuration.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration for BP scripts.

## Getting Started

First of all, create your own repository from this template by clicking the "Use this template"
button in the top right.

After cloning the repository to your local, create a file named `.env` at top-level.
You can set environment variables in there.

An environment variable is a **dynamic named value** that can affect the way running processes will
behave. In this case, it **affects the build script's behavior**.

Copy and paste this to the file:

```env
# Default paths on Windows. You can specify any directory paths.
# Don't forget to replace {USERNAME} with actual user directory name
DEV_BEHAVIOR_PACKS_DIR="C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft Bedrock\Users\Shared\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs"
DEV_RESOURCE_PACKS_DIR="C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft Bedrock\Users\Shared\games\com.mojang\development_resource_packs"
```

Then, open `build.ts` found in the `scripts/` folder, and change things to your liking.

Run the following command to build in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run build:dev
```

After the command is complete, build output can be found in the `build/` folder.
Also they have been copied into locations you specified earlier in the `.env` file
(`development_behavior_packs` and `development_resource_packs`).

Try these too:

```bash
# Watch for file changes and rebuild automatically
pnpm run build:dev:watch
```

```bash
# Create non-dev build v0.6.9
pnpm dotenv -v VERSION=0.6.9 -- pnpm run build
```

Take a look inside [package.json](./package.json) to know what these scripts do.

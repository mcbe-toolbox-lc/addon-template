Key points:

- 📂 Both the behavior pack and the resource pack reside in the same "project folder"
- 🛡️ Your project folder can be located outside of the potentially dangerous `com.mojang` folder
- ⚡ One command to build (compile) the packs and copy them into the `com.mojang` folder
- ☑️ TypeScript is supported out of the box
- 📦 Easy integration of external packages through npm

Details are explained below.
